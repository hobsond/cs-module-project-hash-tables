two main components 
have a key and a value (record)

implement an associated array 

write a hash function
it looks at a key evaluetes 
and spits out an index 

it takes in a key and gives an index number

how to avoid collisoin 
create a linked list off each index 
this is called chaining

Hash tables 

what they solve 

Main hash table operations: GET PUT DELETE
first encode list 
then got through the list

FNV-1
______________________________________________________________________
To do 

implement a hash table class //done 

Implement a hash table entry class

implement a good hashing function

research DJB2
research : FNV-1
Log research

implement the hash_index() that returns an index value for a key

implement the put ,get, and delete methods.. 


________________________________________________________________________
create a bucket node that will will have a head and tail 
when you insert  into the bucket
if the bucket head is  empty
it set the head of the bucket to the a new NOde
set the tail to the new node

else 
	set current tail next to the new item
	set the new item to the tail
